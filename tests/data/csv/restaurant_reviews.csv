"The tasting menu at Chef Laurent's was extraordinary, with each course perfectly paired with wine."
Worst pizza I have ever had. The crust was soggy and the toppings were barely there.
"We had a wonderful brunch at the cafe by the river. The eggs Benedict were flawless, and the coffee was strong and smooth."
The burger was dry and tasteless. I would not go back.
"Absolutely loved the ramen here. Rich broth, tender pork, and perfectly cooked noodles."
"The service was painfully slow, and when our food finally arrived, it was cold."
"Great little bakery with fresh croissants and the best sourdough in town. I stop by every Saturday morning."
"Oh sure, nothing says fine dining like microwaved bread and canned soup."
"The sushi was fresh, the presentation was beautiful, and the omakase was worth every penny."
Our delivery order arrived 90 minutes late and the fries were completely soggy.
"Charming neighborhood bistro with a lovely patio. The steak frites were cooked to perfection."
The coffee was lukewarm and tasted like it had been sitting for hours.
"Best tacos I have found outside of Mexico. The al pastor was incredible and the salsa verde had real kick."
"The waiter was rude, the music was too loud, and the pasta was overcooked. Never again."
"I took my family here for my daughter's birthday and they made it so special. The dessert was on the house and the staff sang for her."
"The fried chicken sandwich was decent, I guess. Nothing to write home about but it filled me up."
"We celebrated our anniversary at this restaurant and it was magical. The duck confit melted in my mouth."
"Ordered the lobster roll for twenty-eight dollars and got maybe three bites of actual lobster. Total ripoff."
The chocolate cake from this bakery is hands down the best dessert I have ever tasted.
"My steak was supposed to be medium-rare but came out well done. When I sent it back, the replacement was even worse."
"The cocktail bar has an inventive menu and the bartenders really know their craft. Try the smoked old fashioned."
"I found a hair in my soup. The manager offered no apology, just a shrug."
"Cozy little cafe with amazing pastries and a great selection of teas. Perfect spot for a rainy afternoon."
The portion sizes at this place are laughable. I left hungrier than when I arrived.
"Solid neighborhood Thai place. The pad see ew is reliably good and the green curry has nice heat to it."
"We waited forty-five minutes for a table despite having a reservation. Completely unacceptable."
"The wood-fired pizza here is authentic Neapolitan style. Thin, charred, and absolutely delicious."
The fish and chips were greasy and the batter was falling apart. Very disappointing.
"Everything on the brunch menu is fantastic, but the lemon ricotta pancakes are the real star."
"The place looks trendy but the food does not live up to the hype. Overpriced and underseasoned."
"Honestly the meal was fine. Not great, not terrible. The chicken was a little dry but the sides were okay."
"Love this food truck. The bao buns are pillowy soft and the fillings are always creative and flavorful."
"Waited in the drive-through for twenty minutes only to get the wrong order. This location is always a mess."
"The prix fixe dinner was a culinary journey. Every dish was thoughtfully composed and beautifully plated."
"Took a chance on the new Indian place and was blown away. The butter chicken and garlic naan were phenomenal."
"The buffet looked like it had not been refreshed in hours. Dried out meats and wilted salad. Hard pass."
"My espresso was pulled perfectly and the barista was friendly and knowledgeable about the beans they source."
"The vegan options were surprisingly bland. For a place that markets itself as plant-based, I expected much more."
"I have been coming to this diner for years. The meatloaf and mashed potatoes remind me of home cooking."
"The delivery packaging was great and the food arrived hot. The pad thai was just as good as dining in."
