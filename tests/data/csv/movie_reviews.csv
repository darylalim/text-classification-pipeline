"Oppenheimer was a masterclass in tension and storytelling. Cillian Murphy deserved every award he got."
The new Spider-Man was just okay. Nothing special about the plot.
"I turned off the documentary halfway through, it was so poorly edited and the narration felt condescending."
"Miyazaki's The Boy and the Heron is visually stunning, and the emotional depth caught me off guard."
"What a waste of two hours. The dialogue was wooden, the pacing was awful, and the twist was predictable from the first scene."
This indie film about a grieving violinist completely broke me. I haven't cried like that in years.
"Oh sure, another superhero sequel. Truly groundbreaking cinema."
"The Bear season two is the best thing on streaming right now. Every episode feels like a short film."
I expected nothing from that Netflix original and somehow it still disappointed me.
"Barbie was surprisingly sharp and self-aware. Greta Gerwig found the perfect balance between humor and heart."
"Killers of the Flower Moon was long, but every minute felt earned. Scorsese still has it."
The CGI in the latest Fast and Furious looked like a video game cutscene from 2010.
"I finally watched Parasite and I understand the hype. Bong Joon-ho is a genius."
"The acting was fine, but the script needed at least two more rewrites before it was ready for cameras."
"Across the Spider-Verse raised the bar for animation. The art direction alone is worth the ticket price."
I regret spending money on that horror remake. Not a single genuine scare in the entire film.
"Succession stuck the landing with its final season. Devastating and perfect."
"The new Star Wars series on Disney+ started strong but completely fell apart by the midseason finale."
"Moonlight remains one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Barry Jenkins captures emotion like no one else."
That romantic comedy was painfully generic. I could have written the ending after watching the trailer.
"Past Lives is a quiet, devastating film about the roads not taken. I thought about it for days afterward."
"The pacing of that thriller was relentless. I didn't look at my phone once during the entire runtime."
I walked out of that animated sequel feeling nothing. It had none of the charm of the original.
"Everything Everywhere All at Once is chaotic and brilliant. It made me laugh and sob within the same scene."
"Honestly, the documentary about the chess grandmaster was more gripping than any blockbuster I saw this year."
"Terrible sound mixing ruined the whole experience. I couldn't understand half the dialogue even with the volume cranked up."
"I rewatched The Shawshank Redemption for the tenth time and it still holds up as one of the greatest films ever made."
The sequel nobody asked for turned out to be the sequel nobody needed.
"Shogun on FX was an absolute revelation. The attention to historical detail and the performances were extraordinary."
"The villain had zero motivation, the love interest was a cardboard cutout, and the climax made no sense."
"I went in expecting a standard biopic but got a deeply moving portrait of an artist fighting against the world."
"That streaming original about the con artist started well, but the last two episodes felt rushed and unsatisfying."
"Studio Ghibli rereleases on the big screen are a gift. Seeing Spirited Away in a theater again was pure magic."
"I have never been so bored by an action movie. Explosions do not equal entertainment."
"The Holdovers was a warm, funny, quietly profound film. Paul Giamatti was absolutely phenomenal in it."
"This was the kind of prestige drama that tries so hard to be important it forgets to be interesting."
"Beef on Netflix was raw and unpredictable. Both leads gave career-best performances."
"I guess it was fine? The cinematography was gorgeous but the story didn't leave much of an impression."
"Poor Things is wild, inventive, and unlike anything I have seen in years. Emma Stone is fearless in it."
"Another bloated franchise entry with a two-and-a-half-hour runtime that could have been trimmed to ninety minutes."
